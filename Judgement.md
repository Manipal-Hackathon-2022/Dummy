## Demo 

- Website live demo 
- Video hosting link
- App demo on iOS or Android
- Hardware demo using components
- Code-Review and Cross Examination by judges

### Commit Limit
- No limit to the number of commits until the coding sprints. 
- Any commit made to the repositories after the elapsation of coding time will be deleted by brute-force, without any reagrds to disruption of the remaining project.

- Use the first half for Demo, 2nd half for QnA.
- Using up more time for the demo will eat into the QnA time, no extra time will be awarded.

### Power Judging

- All the judges will interact with entire participant pool of M#
- Demos and quick discussions will follow, a speed round of sorts.
